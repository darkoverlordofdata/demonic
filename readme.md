# Dark Overlord of Data's Demonic Practice Amp

A practice guitar amp that runs in your browser

Written for my Chromebook

built and tested using [Faust IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr/index.html)

to install/run visit https://darkoverlordofdata.com/demonic

This is not a modeling amp. You cannot select what tubes and cabinet you like. All you get is a generic practice amp.
At present you can select Amplifier, Flanger, Chorus, and Reverb. You can play with knobs and dials.
My main use case is that I can practice along side youtube as well as various tablature playback sites such as ultimate-guitar:

todo
* hide/display visualization panel
* add metronome

### compatability

* Inspiron - XUbuntu 22.04  - Chrome Browser / Firefox / Edge
* Inspiron - ChromeOS Flex 
* Chromebook - Lenovo Duet 2
* Android Phone (LG K51)

Tested with Behringer Guitar Link USB Interface UC6102
On linux, disable jackd if running, it will work better

USBC to USB converter required for phone. It also loads slow.
