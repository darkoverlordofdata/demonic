# halfass

A Half Ass practice guitar amp that runs in your browser

Written for my Chromebook

built, tested, and compiled using [Faust IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr/index.html)

to install/run visit https://darkoverlordofdata.com/halfass

This is not a modeling amp. You cannot select what tubes and cabinet you like. All you get is a generic practice amp.

At present you can select Amplifier, Flanger, Chorus, and Reverb. You can play with knobs and dials.

Future plans? I'm retired, so we'll see. Want to contribute https://github.com/darkoverlordofdata/halfass
